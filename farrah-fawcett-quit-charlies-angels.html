However, there were financial, creative and personal considerations that compelled her to leave.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Money may have motivated Fawcett's departure</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fawcett played a key role in attracting viewers to Charlie's Angels. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/06/25/farrah-fawcett-dies-of-cancer-at-62/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to series producer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to series producer</a> Aaron Spelling, "Her hair helped make the show. It became one of our signatures." Yet she was only paid $5,000 per episode, half of what co-star Jackson, who was better known prior to the show's launch, made. And while everything from lunchboxes to board games featured Fawcett's face, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/09/farrah-fawcett200909 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she received just two percent" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she received just two percent</a> of the merchandising income.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thanks to the success of the first season, which ran from 1976-77, Fawcett was in line for a raise to $10,000 per episode, but, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/03/08/flight-of-an-angel/aea07fa9-f383-4cbd-a278-3ef8b404f8b4/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Washington Post</a>, it was rumored she wanted $75,000. In terms of merchandising, she reportedly requested 10 percent. However, the production company discovered Fawcett wasn't interested in negotiating. "I would say, 'Well, Farrah, if we give you eight percent?' and she would say, 'Well, no, I don't know,'" producer Leonard Goldberg recounted to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/09/farrah-fawcett200909 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanity Fair</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Fawcett said she wanted to make movies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perhaps Fawcett didn't haggle over her Angels income because movies seemed to present the opportunity to earn a bigger payday. Early in 1977, she'd shared with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/01/05/farrah-fawcett-majors-i-just-laugh/8171821f-1d92-4e3d-8654-d954d237db13/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Washington Post</a> that she wanted to make a "picture with real woman's emotions," and co-star Smith has confirmed Fawcett "wanted to do features instead of a series." As Fawcett had millions of fans who watched her on TV and purchased her famous poster, it made sense to think the public would pay to watch her on the big screen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fawcett and then-husband, Six Million Dollar Man star <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lee-majors data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lee Majors" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lee Majors</a>, created Fawcett-Majors Productions to produce their own films. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMRLYiqIT6w" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to Goldberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to Goldberg</a>, Angels producers tried to tempt the actress with a deal to have her star in an upcoming movie while continuing to fulfill her Angels duties. Fawcett would also have had the opportunity to make more feature films in the future. However, she didn't take this offer.</p><img alt="Farrah Fawcett Charlies Angels" title="Farrah Fawcett Charlies Angels" width=4192 height=2797 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-92995646.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Farrah Fawcett filming during season one of 'Charlie's Angels'; Photo: Walt Disney Television via Getty Images Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Fawcett was interested in creative growth</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, producers couldn't guarantee Fawcett's creative satisfaction on Charlie's Angels. "I want them to start showing she's had some hard knocks, too, and cries, and is sad," she told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/01/05/farrah-fawcett-majors-i-just-laugh/8171821f-1d92-4e3d-8654-d954d237db13/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Washington Post</a>. "Who's gonna care about her if all she does is say, 'Ooo! This week I get to play the hooker?'" But Fawcett understood the limitations of starring on a program that had been labeled "jiggle TV," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/television/26fawcett.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=saying class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">saying</a> at one point, "When the show got to be No. 3, I figured it was our acting. When it got to be No. 1, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Knowing that Charlie's Angels was never going to be a creatively fulfilling endeavor was another factor in Fawcett's decision to go. "For me to have stayed, I would have been very unhappy and I don't think I would have done good work. We didn't have, in my opinion, the greatest writers on that show," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aetv.com/specials/biography-farrah-fawcett-forever data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she once stated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she once stated</a>. "Creatively, I just felt stifled. So, it was time for me to leave."</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Majors encouraged Fawcett to quit the show</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to creative and business motivations, marital concerns likely played a role in Fawcett's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-when-angels-were-the-rage-vol-26-no-16/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="decision to quit" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">decision to quit</a> Charlie's Angels. Making the show called for long days that could begin at five in the morning. When not busy with Charlie's Angels, she still had commercials to make on the weekend. Fawcett herself admitted, "I was working very hard, I wasn't pleased with the hours."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fawcett reportedly had a clause in her contract that said she needed to finish on set in time to go home and make dinner for her husband, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-super-powered-love-vol-5-no-2/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>. Yet starring on two TV shows meant the couple had less time for each other. Majors, who'd <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/1976-farrah-fawcett-vol-21-no-9/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="advised his wife" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">advised his wife</a> about her career from the time she'd first arrived in Hollywood, encouraged her to leave Charlie's Angels to make movies. However, the marriage didn't last – by 1979 the couple had separated and officially divorced three years later.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Fawcett may have wanted a break from stardom</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to long hours, making Charlie's Angels could be dangerous. While on location, Fawcett once had a run-in with a race car that left her leg severely bruised. Plus outshining her co-stars had drawbacks. "I felt uncomfortable when all of a sudden I got more attention and fan mail than Jaclyn Smith or Kate Jackson," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-rowdy-romance-vol-15-no-18/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she told People</a> in 1981. "I felt them change, not outwardly, but inwardly. We never had any arguments, but I felt a little barrier."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With legions of fans, Fawcett couldn't enjoy a normal life when she wasn't working. She would be surrounded anytime she went out in public and had to cut back on regular activities. And she believed she needed to take steps to adapt to her new life, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://abc.com/movies-and-specials/this-is-farrah-fawcett data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="saying in 1984" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">saying in 1984</a>, "I became successful before I was ready for it or knew what I was doing. The success came before I had done what I thought was a good role. I knew that if I was going to stay in the business I had to change and I wanted to change."</p><img alt="Farrah Fawcett Charlies Angels" title="Farrah Fawcett Charlies Angels" width=4026 height=2727 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-92995467.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Walt Disney Television via Getty Images Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A lawsuit was filed against Fawcett when she quit</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">No matter the reasons behind Fawcett's decision to leave, she wasn't able to simply walk away from her hit show. The show's production company insisted she was under contract, but she told People that she "started to film Charlie’s Angels before my contract was worked out." A $7 million breach of contract suit was filed against her when she quit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The dispute was settled with an agreement that Fawcett would guest star in six more episodes throughout the remainder of the series, which ran until 1981. However, she said she was blackballed for other projects because she'd left the show. "The whole lawsuit almost sank me," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-why-farrah-split-vol-12-no-8/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she revealed to People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she revealed to People</a> in 1979. "The industry was furious with me and hostile because I was a TV sex symbol who wanted to be an actress. People thought I was really pretentious, and for months no one would touch me."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Charlie's Angels' was always part of Fawcett's life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fawcett's career never reached the same heights after she left Charlie's Angels. Her first film post-Angels, Somebody Killed Her Husband (1978), was a failure that became known as "Somebody Killed Her Career." With Fawcett's departure, actress Cheryl Ladd began appearing on Charlie's Angels as the younger sister of Fawcett's character. Fawcett admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/faberges-not-giving-farrah-the-business-just-a-little-contract-worth-millions-vol-8-no-17/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>, "I was surprised that I was so easy to replace."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the years, Fawcett continued to be identified with Charlie's Angels, even as she garnered respect as an actress by appearing off-Broadway and earning an Emmy Award nomination for the TV movie The Burning Bed (1984). Yet she also benefited from the lasting ties the show had created — when Fawcett was diagnosed with anal cancer, Jackson and Smith (both breast cancer survivors) gathered to support their fellow "angel" until her death in 2009.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVonZqqopa1brLAsJqerKRivra102aaoZmiobamv4yapaCdnKg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffarrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffarrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffarrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffarrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffarrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffarrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./xxxtentacion-mugshot-and-arrest-charges.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./xxxtentacion-mugshot-and-arrest-charges.html>XXXTentacion Mugshot And Arrest Charges: Where Is He Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-thousand-faces-of-dunjia-2017.html>The Thousand Faces of Dunjia movie review (2017)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-thousand-faces-of-dunjia-2017.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
