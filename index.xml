Spoofs of the Good Book are fine by me; they just need to be funny, but Van Dormael (‚ÄúToto the Hero‚Äù) is no Monty Python or Mel Brooks.</description></item><item><title>Gimli role that dwarfs the rest</title><link>/gimli-role-that-dwarfs-the-rest.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gimli-role-that-dwarfs-the-rest.html</guid><description>By RUSSELL BAILLIE
John Rhys-Davies likes to say he told you so. The British character actor does just that in a deep, melodious Welsh accent. Though should you mention his two Lord of the Rings voices - of dwarf Gimli and Treebeard - he will slip into their respective tones in an instant. You imagine if there are LOTR fan conventions in years to come, Rhys-Davies will rise from unrecognisable supporting actor to headline act.</description></item><item><title>Kenneth Chesebro Wikipedia And Age | How Old Is The Attorney</title><link>/kenneth-chesebro-wikipedia-and-age-how-old-is-the-attorney.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/kenneth-chesebro-wikipedia-and-age-how-old-is-the-attorney.html</guid><description>He has represented plaintiffs in numerous well-known litigation against corporations, handling over 100 cases before the US Supreme Court and various lower courts.
