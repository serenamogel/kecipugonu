Born into a boxing family, with both his father and uncle being former fighters and his trainers, Jesus Ramos Jr. has made a name for himself in the sport. Jesus Ramos is a rising star in the boxing world, born into a family of boxers and trainers.</p><p>He was inspired to follow in the footsteps of his father and uncle, both former fighters, and started boxing at the age of 4, but only began competing at 8 years old. Jesus Jr. is a welterweight fighter, like his uncle Abel, who also competes in the professional ranks. This article will provide a comprehensive overview of his life and career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_Biography_Education></span><strong>Early Life, Biography & Education</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jesus Ramos Jr. was born on 7 March 2001 (Wednesday), in Casa Grande, Arizona, USA, making him 22 years old at present. His father, Jesus Ramos Sr., and uncle, Efrain Ramos, were both boxers, and they introduced him to the sport from a very young age. He attended Vista Grande High School for his studies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/An-old-photo-of-Jesus.jpg><p>Ramos Jr. began his amateur career at the age of eight, and he quickly established himself as a talented fighter. He won numerous national championships and was eventually selected to represent the United States at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jesuss-old-photo.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jesus_Ramos_Joey_Spencer_Fight></span><strong>Jesus Ramos & Joey Spencer Fight</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On the Benavidez-Plant undercard, Cody Crowley prevailed in a close contest, Chris Colbert was awarded a decision that was highly contentious, and Jesus Ramos dominated. Sadly for Spencer, the match ended up being the mismatch that many people had feared it would be. The 22-year-old from Michigan was knocked out in the first round, but he still dominated until his corner rightly called it quits in round seven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jesus-Ramos-net-worth.jpg><p>Spencer (16-1, 10 KO)’s steady diet of carefully chosen opponents on PBC’s terrible FOX shows did him no favors in this fight, as he came up against a guy who was just too good and left Spencer looking helpless at times, despite the great effort he put in. Ramos (20-0, 16 KO) was too big, too skilled, too strong, and just too good. Spencer (16-1, 10 KO).</p><p>CompuBox recorded Ramos landing 172 of his total 413 punches and 147 of his total 317 power shots, a dominant performance compared to Spencer’s 48 of his total 355 punches and 47 of his total 242 power shots. Ramos connected on 25 of 96 jabs, or 26 percent, while Spencer connected on just 1 of 113 (1%). In addition, Ramos hit 32 body shots, while Spencer hit 13.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Height_Weight_Body_Stats></span><strong>Height, Weight & Body Stats </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jesus Ramos Jr. stands at a height of 5’10” (178 cm) and competes in the welterweight division.
