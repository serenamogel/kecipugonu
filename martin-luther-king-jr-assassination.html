He had returned to lead a march 10 days later, only to see the demonstration dissolve into rioting and chaos that left a high school student dead.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dismayed by the outcome and discouraged by staffers who wanted him to focus on the upcoming "Poor People's Campaign" in the nation's capital, King nevertheless was determined to lead a second, successful march in Memphis to prove that his method of nonviolent demonstration still had teeth.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">King was 'exhausted' during his last days</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As recounted in the book Redemption: Martin Luther King Jr.'s Last 31 Hours, MLK's Memphis plans faced hurdles from the get-go, starting with the bomb threat that delayed his flight out of Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After arriving, King and his cohorts were slapped with an injunction that prevented them from leading a demonstration in the city. He huddled with his legal team at the Lorraine Motel to discuss strategy, and followed with another meeting with a local Black power group called the Invaders, aiming to head off a potential repeat of the riot-instigating actions that had torpedoed his last effort.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fighting a cold, and exhausted after weeks of traveling, King sent his chief lieutenant, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/ralph-d-abernathy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ralph Abernathy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ralph Abernathy</a>, to speak on his behalf at Bishop Charles Mason Temple that evening. Although the stormy weather had depressed the turnout, Abernathy sensed the crowd's disappointment with King's absence and convinced the celebrated orator by phone to make an appearance.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He delivered his famed 'I've Been to the Mountaintop' speech one day before his death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In what became known as his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/ive-been-mountaintop-address-delivered-bishop-charles-mason-temple data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"I&#39;ve Been to the Mountaintop" speech' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"I've Been to the Mountaintop" speech</a>, King took the audience on a time-traveling journey through the highlights of human civilization and revealed that here, amid the struggle for human rights in the second half of the 20th century, was exactly where he wanted to be. He then recalled how he had been stabbed 10 years earlier when a mere sneeze could have ruptured his aorta and prevented him from being part of civil rights history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I don't know what will happen now; we've got some difficult days ahead," he said, nearing the prescient climax. "But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life — longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And so I'm happy tonight; I'm not worried about anything; I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Utterly spent, King was helped back to his seat, tears welling in his eyes. However, the emotional speech was cathartic for a man who had endured so much stress. In the biography Bearing the Cross, Abernathy recalled how his friend seemed "happy and relaxed" at dinner after the rally, and King found the energy to stay up well into the night, joking around with the others.</p><img alt='Martin Luther King during his "I&#39;ve Been to the Mountaintop" speech' title='Martin Luther King during his "I&#39;ve Been to the Mountaintop" speech' width=4206 height=2807 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-517481466.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Getty Images</span><p>Martin Luther King delivering his "I’ve Been to the Mountaintop" speech on April 3, 1968</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">King was shot in the face on a motel balcony</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After waking up late on April 4, King discussed organizational matters with his staffers, before hearing the good news: His lawyers had persuaded the judge to lift the injunction, allowing for a tightly controlled march on April 8.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At around 6 p.m., as he prepared for dinner with a local minister, King stepped out to the balcony of room 306 at the Lorraine to chat with colleagues waiting in the courtyard below. A gunshot suddenly pierced the air, and the others recovered from their momentary confusion to find King prone on the balcony, bleeding profusely from the right side of his face.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although he was rushed off to St. Joseph's Hospital relatively quickly, the bullet had punctured several vital arteries, fractured his spine, and 39-year-old King was declared dead at 7:05 p.m.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Riots and tributes followed his death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King's assassination led to the outbreak of violence across American cities, with reports of more than 40 casualties, another 3,500 injuries and 27,000 arrests accumulating over the next several days. But there were also noble tributes to the slain civil rights leader: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/lyndon-b-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Lyndon B.

The following day, another 50,000 supporters accompanied King's mule-drawn casket through downtown Atlanta, to South-View Cemetery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On April 16, the cause that had consumed the final days of King's life realized its goal, as the city of Memphis agreed to improved wages and the recognition of the sanitation workers' union.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">James Earl Ray pleaded guilty, though conspiracy theories remain</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/memphis-hunt/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="massive manhunt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">massive manhunt</a> led the FBI from Bessie Brewer's Rooming House, across from the Lorraine Motel, to California, Alabama, Canada, Portugal and finally to London's Heathrow Airport, where <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/james-earl-ray data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Earl Ray" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Earl Ray</a> was apprehended on June 8. He pleaded guilty the following March, earning a 99-year prison sentence, but almost immediately recanted the plea, insisting he was part of a larger conspiracy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a twist, many members of King's family and inner circle eventually went public their <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/who-killed-martin-luther-king-james-earl-ray-mlk-assassination data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="belief that Ray was not the killer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">belief that Ray was not the killer</a>.

This spurred the launch of a new investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice, which ultimately determined that there was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/03/30/who-killed-martin-luther-king-jr-his-family-believes-james-earl-ray-was-framed/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="no reason to reopen the case" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">no reason to reopen the case</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">More than 50 years after King's final breath, the full story behind his killing remains unknown. Nevertheless, the tragedy cemented his place as an icon of the transformative era, forever frozen on the mountaintop as a man who lived out his life in the service of others.</p><img alt="Police stand with civil rights leaders (L-R) Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Jesse Jackson and others on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel over the body of Martin Luther King Jr." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2864527.jpg title="Police stand with civil rights leaders (L-R) Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Jesse Jackson and others on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel over the body of Martin Luther King Jr." width=3150 height=2550 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJopJqqpJ67brjUrZ%2Beql2gtq%2BzjKOpZpmjqK60v8inmK2hn6M%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmartin-luther-king-jr-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmartin-luther-king-jr-assassination.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmartin-luther-king-jr-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmartin-luther-king-jr-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmartin-luther-king-jr-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmartin-luther-king-jr-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-best-crab-melt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-best-crab-melt.html>The BEST Crab Melt - Mom On Timeout</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./richard-tyson-net-worth-2024.html>Richard Tyson Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./richard-tyson-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
