<time>28 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>D’banj is a celebrated musician who through his songs has taken the music scene, particularly in Africa by storm. He is a Nigerian songwriter, businessman, and harmonica player who has also won several musical awards. Just like most celebrities, D’banj has managed to keep his private life out of the limelight, and very little is known about him. But here we bring you 10 things you might not have known about the entertainer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dbanji-biography-age-family></span>D’Banji Biography, Age, Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born on 9th June 1980 in Zaria, Northern Nigeria, D’banji’s birth name is Oladapo Daniel Oyebanj. He chose to take up the stage D’banji which he combined from his name Dapo and his surname Oyebanjo. His father, a military officer commanded an artillery unit while his God-fearing church dignitary mother is into business. As a son of a military man, he was expected to go in the ways of his father. He joined a military school when he was eleven and became a member of renowned drum corp of the Nigerian Army. He left the school three years later because he was tired of the environment and joined another military school “Nigerian Navy Secondary School”, Ibara Abeokuta where he finished his secondary school level. Immediately after completing secondary education, his father’s wish was for him to join the military. However, having set his eyes on music, D’banj paid deaf ears to his dad, he persisted and eventually managed to pursue his childhood dream. Just like most musicians, D’banj struggled to start his music career just as much as it took him to convince his father to win his support as it was against his father’s wish.</p><p>The singer started his musical career by playing his late elder brother’s harmonica. His brother had died in a plane crash at age 17. To pay tribute to him and to keep his memory alive in his mind, D’banj always played the harmonica. But the motive behind his new skills changed while at the University as girls were attracted to him for his skills. This made him play it more often than not at the female hostel. That notwithstanding, he dropped his dream of becoming a mechanical Engineer halfway due to constant strike at Lagos State University.</p><p>D’banji moved to the UK in 2001 to further his studies but also had to quit after he met Don Jazzy who was an aspiring songwriter then. Their meeting caused D’banj to huggle between going to the studio and working as a security man in London. However, he and Don Jazzy decided to head back to Lagos in 2004 as Nigerian music sphere was evolving. After he dropped “Tonglo”, he got a deal with an energy drink known as Power Fist. The singer uses Afrobeat and Afropop due to his love for his mentor, who was a top Nigerian singer, Fela Kuti.</p><p>To date, D’banj boasts of over five albums including No Long Thing (his debut album released in 2005), Rundown Fuck U Up (2006), Curriculum Vitae & The Entertainer (2007-2008). He got signed to Kanye West’s G.O.O.D Music record label via Mo’Hits in 2011. However, Mo’Hits split up months later. Luckily for him, he got signed with Sony Entertainment Deal in 2012. In 2017, he released his single “King Don Come” with guest features such as Gucci Mane, Wande Coal, etc. His record label DKM is also doing great.</p><p>D’banj has also bagged up to 13 international awards including KORA All Africa Music Awards, MTV Africa Music Awards and the BET among others.</p><p>‘Kokomaster’ as some of his die-hard fans call him has managed to collaborate with some of the best-known and top-selling artists in the world, including Snoop Dogg,&nbsp;Jay-Z, and Kanye West. This has since seen his music career light up even more as his music has gained international recognition and acceptance.</p><p>In addition to singing, D’banj is also a gifted actor and has featured in several short films, including Kanye West’s film “Cruel Summers’’. This is besides many other Nollywood productions that he has featured in.</p><p>Due to his sex appeal, several music awards and a continuing relevance in the music industry, D’banj became the first Nigerian to be named the United Nations Youth Ambassador For Peace. He is without a doubt one of the most celebrated pop stars to ever come out of Nigeria.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=married-wife-kids></span>Married, Wife, Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In an interview, the ‘Kokomaster’ revealed his ravishing love for celebrated Nigerian Nollywood superstar,&nbsp;Genevieve. Heaping praises on the star, DBanj said she is his dream wife! He went ahead to say that one who can acquire her as a wife would have won for himself a treasure. He even quoted a phrase from the Bible to that effect. Regardless of the nice talks, D Banji revealed his son Daniel Oyebanjo III with his wife Lineo Didi Kilgrow in 2017, years after he said that. Not much is known about his wife and kid but the D’banj and Didi got married at a secret wedding in 2016. The revelation shocked his fans who thought he could have married the lady he eulogized.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net&nbsp; Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thanks to his music that sells internationally and many other production deals, D’banj is one of the richest musicians on the African continent. According to a list released in September 2013 by Forbes Africa and Channel O, he was ranked the fourth richest artist in Africa. The star has been involved in some bad investments with his Koko Mobile and Koko Garri&nbsp;becoming a failure. But he remains among Nigerian artists receiving highest amounts of money for both local and international performances.</p><p>The musician gets somewhere between $31,000 and a further $44,200 as performance fee for any local shows he appears in. The figures are even higher when he performs internationally. So, you can just figure how much D’banj bags every Saturday he has a performance. It clearly shows why he makes it to the list of richest African artists.</p><p>In addition, to live performance fees as seen above, D’banj also gets a fat paycheck from his endorsement deals with some of the leading Nigerian companies. For instance, he signed a deal with Globacom Telecommunications valued at $442,000. This is besides another multi-million endorsement deal with energy drink giant Power Fist, soft drink company Virgin colours and another with a leading Jewellery company. This clearly shows why D’banj laughs all the way to the bank!&nbsp;There is no denying that D’banj has made a name in the musical scene. While this celebrated musician is known for his music, not much is known about his private life and that includes his exact net worth. That notwithstanding, he is allegedly worth N5 billion.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=house-cars></span><strong>House, Cars</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The singer owned a mansion in Lekki area that its worth estimated at $25 million. The house was sealed sometime in the past and rumour had it that he was in debt. Some said he owned up to $300,000 in debt he borrowed from Ojogbo Henry in 2013 while others said he was yet to pay his housekeepers. However, no one knows the real reason the house got sealed by Nigerian authorities. Later on, the house was finally resold but good enough, he has other houses to support him. Among them is his house in London where he stays when he goes to London for gigs and a large impressive house in the US. When it comes to cars, D’banj knows how to give himself a treat. He has many cars in his garage and they include an Aston Vintage ($200 million), 2 Toyota Jeeps.&nbsp;Apart from cars, D’banj also owns a custom-bulletproof jet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJySlrurecGipqCqkaW1unnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5zJqpq6GVmXq4tcWeZKShlKh6p63MoqOyZZGcsm60zq6qnmWRo7Fur8Crqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdbanj-biography-net-worth-married-wife-kids-family-age-house-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdbanj-biography-net-worth-married-wife-kids-family-age-house-and-cars.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdbanj-biography-net-worth-married-wife-kids-family-age-house-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdbanj-biography-net-worth-married-wife-kids-family-age-house-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdbanj-biography-net-worth-married-wife-kids-family-age-house-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdbanj-biography-net-worth-married-wife-kids-family-age-house-and-cars.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./diego-fernandez-age-and-biographia-wikipedia-details-of-masterchef-mexico-junior.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./diego-fernandez-age-and-biographia-wikipedia-details-of-masterchef-mexico-junior.html>Diego Fernndez Age And Biographia- Wikipedia Details Of MasterChef Mexico Junior</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./trader-joes-new-mochi-ice-cream-news.html>Trader Joe's Has a New Fall Flavor of Mochi Ice Cream</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./trader-joes-new-mochi-ice-cream-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
