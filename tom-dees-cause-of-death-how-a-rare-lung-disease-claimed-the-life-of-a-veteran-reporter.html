<time>26 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Tom Dees, a longtime reporter for Fox 13 and an Emmy-winning journalist, passed away on Thursday, February 9, 2023, at his home in Olive Branch, Mississippi. He was 57 years old and just a few days shy of his 58th birthday. He is survived by his wife, Cathy, and their three children, Amelia, Ally, and Austin.</p><p>Dees was a beloved figure in the Mid-South community, where he had worked for Fox 13 since 1995. He covered a wide range of stories, from breaking news to human interest features, with a special passion for Northern Mississippi. He won an Emmy award for his coverage of the region and was known for his professionalism, integrity, and humor.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?</strong></h3><p>The cause of death for Tom Dees was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a rare and progressive lung disease that affects the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs. IPF causes scarring and thickening of the lung tissue, making it harder for oxygen to pass through. This leads to symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss.</p><p>The exact cause of IPF is unknown, hence the term “idiopathic”, which means having no known cause. Some possible risk factors include genetic predisposition, smoking, environmental exposure to dust or chemicals, viral infections, and acid reflux. However, none of these factors can explain why some people develop IPF and others do not.</p><p>There is no cure for IPF and the prognosis is poor. The median survival time after diagnosis is about three to five years. The only treatment options are medications that may slow down the progression of the disease, oxygen therapy that may ease the breathing difficulties, and lung transplantation that may extend the life span of some patients.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Tom Dees Fought Against IPF</strong></h3><p>Tom Dees was diagnosed with IPF in early January 2023, after he experienced breathing problems and chest pain. He was hospitalized for several days and underwent various tests and treatments. He was hopeful that he would be eligible for a lung transplant and was waiting for a donor match.</p><p>According to Fox 13, Dees was optimistic about his condition and continued to work from home until his last day. He was in constant communication with his colleagues and friends, sharing updates and jokes. He also received an outpouring of support from his viewers and fans, who sent him messages of encouragement and prayers.</p><p>Dees was not the only one in his family who suffered from IPF. His father, Tom Dees Sr., also had the same disease and passed away in April 2020. His daughter, Ally Dees, created a GoFundMe page to raise funds for her father’s medical expenses and to raise awareness about IPF. She wrote:</p><p>“My dad has spent the past 25 years being the best father me and my two siblings could have asked for. We have had the privilege of meeting so many wonderful people in the Mid-South community because of him, and we have absolute faith that this community will rally to support him during this time.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Tom Dees Will Be Remembered</strong></h3><p>Tom Dees will be remembered as a dedicated journalist who loved his job and his community. He was admired by his peers and respected by his sources. He was also a loving husband and father who cherished his family.</p><p>His colleagues at Fox 13 paid tribute to him on air and online, describing him as a loyal friend and a talented storyteller. They said:</p><p>“To know Tom Dees was to love him. A man with a million questions, his passion for the Mid-South personally and professionally was endearing and admirable. He was a tireless and loyal friend and colleague. He was quick with a self-deprecating quip (usually about his hair, or lack thereof) and could always bring a smile to those around him. He will be missed by all who knew him.”</p><p>His viewers and fans also expressed their condolences and appreciation on social media, thanking him for his service and his stories. They said:</p><p>“Tom Dees was one of my favorite reporters on Fox 13. He always had a smile on his face and a positive attitude. He will be greatly missed.”</p><p>“Tom Dees was a great reporter who always gave us the facts without bias or sensationalism. He was also a kind person who cared about people. He was an asset to our community.”</p><p>“Tom Dees was an amazing storyteller who made us laugh, cry, and think. He touched so many lives with his words and his heart. He was a true professional and a genuine human being.”</p><p>Tom Dees’ funeral arrangements have not been publicly announced yet. His family has requested privacy and respect during this difficult time. They have also asked for donations to the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation in lieu of flowers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfqbyuecOenKxlk5bCtLGMqJ1mnJWWwal5x6iuZpldp66zsYylrKefXZm2tLHArJxmm5yWtq6xw2aroZ1dobansYyonWaZXauytbHRmqVmqpWlvLPAxKtm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-dees-cause-of-death-how-a-rare-lung-disease-claimed-the-life-of-a-veteran-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftom-dees-cause-of-death-how-a-rare-lung-disease-claimed-the-life-of-a-veteran-reporter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftom-dees-cause-of-death-how-a-rare-lung-disease-claimed-the-life-of-a-veteran-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftom-dees-cause-of-death-how-a-rare-lung-disease-claimed-the-life-of-a-veteran-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-dees-cause-of-death-how-a-rare-lung-disease-claimed-the-life-of-a-veteran-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-dees-cause-of-death-how-a-rare-lung-disease-claimed-the-life-of-a-veteran-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jim-gaffigan-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jim-gaffigan-net-worth.html>Jim Gaffigan Net Worth: How Much Does the King of Clean Comedy Make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./retrieving-the-grail-robin-williams-and-the-fisher-king.html>Retrieving the Grail: Robin Williams and &amp;quot;The Fisher King&amp;quot; | Features</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./retrieving-the-grail-robin-williams-and-the-fisher-king.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
