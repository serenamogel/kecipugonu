I think people see pregnancy as something to get over with, but every stage of becoming a mother is really special.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The difference between romantic love and friendship love is that romantic love involves a lot of compromises. It is a very giving type of love. With friendship, you can be a little bit more autonomous. You are not expected to compromise, in the same way. Maybe that’s why friendships tend to last longer.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The mark of a good marriage is the partnership and continuing to feel inspired by your spouse. I had that with Tao. But the end is not necessarily the tragedy. Staying in a relationship that is no longer working is a tragedy. Living unhappily – that’s the tragedy.”</p><p>“I have a lot of friends who I really feel like I can kick back with and let all pretense go and be very comfortable with.”&nbsp;</p><p>“As a woman who works in a male-dominated business – Hollywood, definitely, is one of them – I instinctually knew what that is like. You have to be strong and take care of yourself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6S5qsLImmSwoZyZsm66xK1ksKeiqbVufo9raWagn6x6s7XCoWSiq12ptaq%2FjKmcq6ufo3qquoxrZ2tqX2eAd4OTaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-lissettepma-on-tiktok-age-real-name-and-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-lissettepma-on-tiktok-age-real-name-and-instagram.html>Who Is Lissettepma On TikTok?
