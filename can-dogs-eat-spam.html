They are: pork with ham meat added (that counts as one), salt, water, potato starch, sugar, and sodium nitrite.<h2>Can you eat Spam raw?</h2>Because Spam is already cooked, it can be eaten straight from the can and requires minimal preparation prior to eating.

Average annual Spam consumption on the island of Guam is 16 cans a person.<h2>Why is Spam popular in Hawaii?</h2>The true root of the island's love for SPAM® products goes back to World War II, when the luncheon meat was served to GIs. By the end of the war, SPAM® products were adopted into local culture, with Fried SPAM® Classic and rice becoming a popular meal.<h2>Does Spam expire?</h2>SPAM does not have an expiration date. Instead, it has a “best by” date. This date indicates when SPAM will have likely lost quality, such as losing freshness or flavor. The best-by date of SPAM is approximately 3 years after the date of manufacturing.<h2>Is horse meat in hot dogs?</h2>Furniture giant Ikea said Thursday it pulled hotdogs from its stores in Russia after tests revealed they contained rogue horse meat.
