After graduating, he worked for several local radio stations, including Radio York and Radio Cumbria. In 1998, he became a presenter for Men & Motors, a digital television channel focused on cars and motorsports.</p><p>In 2002, <a href=# rel=noopener>Hammond</a> joined the presenting team of “Top Gear,” a BBC television show about cars that had been running since 1977. Alongside Jeremy Clarkson and James May, Hammond became one of the show’s most recognizable faces, known for his quick wit, affable personality, and love of high-speed cars.</p><p>During his time on “Top Gear,” Hammond took part in numerous challenges and stunts, often putting himself in dangerous situations in pursuit of a good story. He famously crashed a jet-powered car while attempting to break the land speed record in 2006, suffering serious injuries that required several months of recovery.</p><p>In addition to “Top Gear,” Hammond has presented several other television shows, including “Richard Hammond’s Blast Lab,” “Total Wipeout,” and “Crash Course.” He has also written several books, including “On the Edge: My Story,” a memoir about his life and career.</p><p>In 2015, Hammond and his “Top Gear” co-hosts left the show after Clarkson’s contract was not renewed by the BBC following a physical altercation with a producer. The trio went on to create a new car show, “The Grand Tour,” which premiered on Amazon Prime in 2016 and ran for four seasons.</p><p>Outside of his television work, Hammond is known for his passion for cars and motorcycles. He has owned numerous classic cars and often takes part in races and rallies, including the Gumball 3000 and the Isle of Man TT. He is also a keen cyclist and has completed several long-distance rides for charity.</p><p>Hammond has been married to his wife, Amanda “Mindy” Etheridge, since 2002. They have two daughters together, Willow and Isabella. In 2017, Hammond was involved in another serious car accident while filming “The Grand Tour” in Switzerland, but he escaped with minor injuries.</p><p>Despite his success and popularity, Hammond has faced criticism at times for his comments and actions on and off screen. In 2016, he was accused of making a homophobic joke on an episode of “The Grand Tour,” and he has also faced backlash for promoting controversial products, such as a “miracle” weight loss pill.</p><p>Overall, Richard Hammond has become one of the most well-known television personalities in the UK, thanks to his entertaining and often daring work in the world of cars and motoring. Despite some controversies, he remains a beloved figure among fans of “Top Gear,” “The Grand Tour,” and other shows he has worked on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Richard Hammond Height: How Tall Is Richard Hammond?</h2><p>Richard Hammond’s height is 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm). Despite his relatively small stature, Hammond has become a popular and respected television personality, thanks to his engaging personality, quick wit, and passion for cars.</p><p>While some people may think that Hammond’s height would be a disadvantage in the world of television, he has proven that he can hold his own on screen with his larger and taller co-presenters, such as Jeremy Clarkson and James May. In fact, his height has become something of a running joke on “Top Gear,” with the show’s producers often placing him in small cars or making fun of his size.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Despite any jokes or teasing he may receive, Hammond has always maintained a positive attitude and a great sense of humor about his height. He has said in interviews that he believes that his height has helped him to stand out and become more memorable to viewers, and he has never let it hold him back from pursuing his passion for cars and presenting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqugnKCRp7FutMCmpKimlGK1prXGoato</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichard-hammond-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frichard-hammond-height.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frichard-hammond-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frichard-hammond-height.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichard-hammond-height.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichard-hammond-height.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aaron-poole.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aaron-poole.html>Aaron Poole Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jimmy-iovine.html>Jimmy Iovine</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jimmy-iovine.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
