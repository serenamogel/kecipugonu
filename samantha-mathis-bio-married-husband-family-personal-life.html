It then came in 1992 when she was nominated for Best Young Actress, her role in This&nbsp;</span><span>Is My Life</span></p><p><span>Also, in 2005, Samantha was nominated by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television for her role in&nbsp;</span><span>Salem’s Lot</span><span>&nbsp;(2004) (TV).</span></p><h2><strong><span>Samantha Mathis Personal life</span></strong></h2><p><span>One of the best known things about this actress is the tragedy that struck her with the death of her boyfriend and actor, River Phoenix, who died in 1993 at age 23.</span></p><p><span>Phoenix who was an actor and singer before he died of a drug overdose.&nbsp;It happened at the Sunset Strip’s Viper Room with Samantha Mathis and her siblings, Rain, her sister and younger brother, Joaquin, in attendance.</span></p><p><span>The drugs the actor took caused him to convulse for more than five minutes, and by the time paramedics arrived he had already turned dark blue in complete cardiac arrest and flat, before later passing away.</span></p><p><span>Although Samantha denied knowing that the actor was on drugs, many still claimed she wasn’t being completely honest.</span></p><p><span>Speaking of death years later, Samathaa says she found it “completely shattered. It was hard to conceive of your mortality at that age. It’s very strange now to think that I’m not twenty-three and that he will always be twenty-three.”</span></p><h2><strong><span>Samantha Mathis married, husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>Looking at her love life, beautiful Samantha Mathis is not new to the game, she has dated a lot of men, even though she currently has no husband and has never been married .</span></p><p><span>The first person to have a relationship with the 48-year-old actress was American actor and producer Christian Slater, and the relationship only lasted a year.&nbsp;1989 – 1990.</span></p><p><span>Samantha Mathis has also been in relationships with various men, including Adam Duritz (2004-2005), Noah Wyle (1995-1996), Christian Bale (1994), River Phoenix (1992-1993) and John Leguizamo (1991-1992).</span></p><p><span>His most recent relationship was with fellow actor and filmmaker, Colin Hanks, and that was in 2009.
