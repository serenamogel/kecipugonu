Mick Foley was more well known as Mankind and Mark Calaway as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Undertaker</a>. Almost as soon as the match began, Foley would fall 22-feet into legend.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Fifteen years earlier, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Snuka famously jumped off the top of the steel cage</a> and onto his opponent, the Magnificent Muraco, in what is likely the most awe-inspiring wrestling moment of the 1980s. The Madison Square Garden crowd roared in excitement following Snuka’s flight and in that crowd was a teenager named Mick Foley who just found his inspiration.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>However, for many reasons, Foley’s moment in Pittsburgh was far more dangerous. The match actually took place as part of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE</a> pay-per-view King of the Ring.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>Just a couple minutes into the match came the first of two shocking highlights. It was something that only a handful of people knew was going to happen and it stunned everybody watching. Mankind leapt off the cage (it was made to look as if Undertaker was throwing him). <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He fell 22-feet down</a>, and hard, through one of the announcing tables and onto the concrete floor. Undertaker watched, hoping to see Foley move which, eventually, he barely did.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>For several minutes he was attended to, ended up on a gurney, and was eventually being led to the back and, presumably, to a hospital. That’s when the event went from shocking to surreal.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>The fight called for more in the script but only if Foley could continue and to say he wanted to continue is an understatement. Despite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his injuries</a>, which included a separated shoulder, bruised ribs, internal bleeding, and a likely concussion, Foley got up and began walking back to the ring. He climbed the cage again and re-engaged with Undertaker on top of it.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Undertaker then chokeslammed Foley, grabbing him by the neck and slamming him down onto the top of the cage. That’s when the unexpected happened.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>The cage broke. Foley descended clear through it and violently hit the ring canvas some 16 feet below. It seemed obvious that it was unplanned, based on how the cage snapped. To make matters worse, a chair that Foley had brought with him to the top of the cage to use as a weapon on Undertaker, had fallen with him and slammed into his face, shattering several of his teeth and dislocating his jaw. Foley was knocked out cold.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Personnel quickly attended to him again. Calaway, re-telling the story with Foley in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent video posted by WWE</a> to celebrate the 25-year anniversary of the match, said that he wasn’t sure if Foley was still alive. It was a thought most people had who watched the event. Calaway, still trying to be in character as the Undertaker, swooped down onto the ring and asked Terry Funk, a wrestling legend and good friend of Foley who attended to him, if Foley was still alive. Funk told him that Foley was still breathing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://youtu.be/wS110ggmHIM</figure><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Understandably, Foley barely remembers anything from that night, but he was alive. Surely the fight would be stopped but Foley insisted it go on. It did.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Thankfully, the rest of the match featured no more accidents or insane moments, though Foley was soon slammed onto hundreds of thumbtacks, as per his idea before the match. He was finally pinned, offering relief to everyone watching.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>The two stunts, or “bumps” as they’re called in wrestling, are forever embedded into wrestling lore and numerous wrestling magazines have gone on to call it the most memorable match in wrestling history. WWE owner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince McMahon</a> was shaken by the match. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He told Foley</a>, “You have no idea how much I appreciate what you have just done for this company but I never wanna see anything like that again.”</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Foley gave his body to the business in a way that would thankfully not be allowed in wrestling today, and it forced him to retire within two years of this match, at the peak of his career, age 35, but not before he famously tag-teamed with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rock</a>.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=false>He still suffers from chronic pain from the match. One of the most liked wrestlers in the business, Foley has since been inducted into WWE’s Hall of Fame. 25 years later and it’s safe to say that there will never be another match like the Hell in a Cell match in Pittsburgh between the Undertaker and Mankind and, quite honestly, that’s a good thing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeVq7KvwNJoaW5lqZqus7%2BMpZitnaJiwamxjKyfqJubnruoeceeo6VlmaN6onnCnqOlZZ2WwaS0jK2fmqxdqLWwu8pmq6GdXay%2Fpr%2FTpaCnn12svLO4w2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f25-years-later-the-shocking-hell-in-a-cell-match-that-shook-the-wrestling-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f25-years-later-the-shocking-hell-in-a-cell-match-that-shook-the-wrestling-world.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f25-years-later-the-shocking-hell-in-a-cell-match-that-shook-the-wrestling-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f25-years-later-the-shocking-hell-in-a-cell-match-that-shook-the-wrestling-world.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f25-years-later-the-shocking-hell-in-a-cell-match-that-shook-the-wrestling-world.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f25-years-later-the-shocking-hell-in-a-cell-match-that-shook-the-wrestling-world.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./173182-bert-kreischers-family-facts-wife-children.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./173182-bert-kreischers-family-facts-wife-children.html>Bert Kreischer's family: Facts about his wife and children</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./meet-k-viswanaths-parents.html>Meet K.
