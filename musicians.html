He's had his fair share of legal tussles, as well as the obligatory rap beef (with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/50-cent data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="50 Cent" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">50 Cent</a>). He remains a prolific artist, both as a solo performer and as a guest, and his Maybach Music Group has put out albums by artists including Wale, Meek Mill, French Montana and Teedra Moses. While a controversial figure, Ross is held in high esteem within the music industry, signing deals with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/sean-puffy-combs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="P. Diddy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">P. Diddy</a> and earning praise from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/pharrell-williams data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pharrell class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pharrell</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Creation of Rick Ross</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ross was born William Leonard Roberts II in Coahoma County, Mississippi, on January 28, 1976. Raised in Carol City, Florida — an impoverished area of north of Miami — Ross gravitated to the music of street-oriented rappers like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/tupac-shakur data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tupac Shakur" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tupac Shakur</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/biggie-smalls data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Notorious B.I.G." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Notorious B.I.G.</a>, Luther Campbell and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/ice-cube data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ice Cube" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ice Cube</a>. Although he attended Georgia's Albany State University on a football scholarship for a year, Ross started writing rap lyrics that romanticized drug dealing, an act that he saw as a child.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He took his performing name from stories he heard of a drug trafficker named "Freeway" Rick Ross. Ironically, Ross worked as a corrections officer in Florida for almost two years (something he initially denied when it was revealed, but later accepted), but the lure of hip-hop music and the lavish lifestyle of the drug dealers he saw throughout his youth led him in another direction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before adopting the Rick Ross persona, he’d made his debut on former EPMD member Erick Sermon’s 2000 compilation Def Squad Presents Erick Sermon, appearing as Tephlon on a track called "Ain’t Shhh to Discuss." He was eventually signed to an independent Southern rap label, Suave House Records, whose acts also included the popular underground duo 8Ball & MJG. Ross later moved to the Miami-based record label Slip-N-Slide, which released music by hip-hop favorites like Trick Daddy — whom Ross would later tour with — and female rapper Trina.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While he appeared as a guest on several labelmates’ projects, his only solo release would be the promo-only single "Just Chillin'" in 2003. The CEO of Slip-N-Slide, Ted Lucas, would later praise Ross’ solo breakthrough, which happened after he left the label: “I never doubted him musically and lyrically. Ross is an incredible rapper.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Hustlin’' Heats Up, Def Jam Records Deal</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The first proper single from Ross, "Hustlin'," became a smash hit, due to the hypnotic line, "every day I'm hustling," repeated throughout. The single was eventually certified gold, an impressive feat for a brand-new recording artist. It sparked a bidding war with Def Jam Records, headed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jay-z data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jay Z" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jay Z</a>, winning the battle and signing Ross to a highly publicized record deal. The song’s official remix had verses from Young Jeezy and Jay Z, while an unofficial version also included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/lil-wayne data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lil Wayne" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lil Wayne</a>, TI and Busta Rhymes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ross debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart with his 2006 debut, Port of Miami. His sophomore album in 2008, Trilla – named after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/michael-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael Jackson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael Jackson</a>’s Thriller, combined with the Southern slang term "trill" – also debuted at No. 1. Following his success, Ross began to tour extensively and to collaborate with popular acts including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/r-kelly data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="R. Kelly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">R. Kelly</a>, Flo Rida, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/nelly data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Nelly class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nelly</a> and T-Pain. His third album, Deeper Than Rap (2009), reinforced his success, with The New York Times praising it as “unexpectedly fantastic, by far his best. Few rap albums have sounded this assured, this sumptuous, in years.”</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Maybach Music Group, 'God Forgives' Nominated for Grammy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the same year, Ross launched Maybach Music Group (MMG). The label would achieve great success, releasing albums by Meek Mill, Wale and Omarion. Appearances by Ross and his signings on other artists' tracks would almost always be accompanied by a "Maybach Music" drop — a vocal tagline by the supermodel Jessica Gomes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Running a label didn’t appear to slow down Ross’ personal output. Teflon Don in 2010 was followed by the MMG compilation Self Made Vol. 1 a year later, and then by God Forgives, I Don’t in 2012. During this time he worked with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kanye-west data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kanye West" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kanye West</a>, Gucci Mane, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/cee-lo-green data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CeeLo Green" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">CeeLo Green</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/drake data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Drake class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Drake</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dr-dre data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Dre" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dr. Dre</a> and Andre 3000.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">God Forgives was nominated for a best-album Grammy in 2013, and he followed with Mastermind and Hood Billionaire, both in 2014, but reviews were mixed and sales only modest — perhaps a sign that he was releasing too much music too quickly, diluting the quality. Album No. 8, Black Market, came out at the close of 2015. His ninth, Rather You Than Me, dropped in 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In August 2019, Ross unveiled his 10th studio album, Port of Miami 2, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Corrections Officer Past Exposed, 50 Cent Feud</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Ross' notoriety grew, thanks to his lyrics about drug dealing and hustling, his past career in law enforcement began to interest the public, too. It was an intriguing contradiction that first came to light in 2008, when a website known as The Smoking Gun exposed Ross as having previously worked as a corrections officer in South Florida. Although this raised doubts about Ross' street credibility, the rapper brushed them aside.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He has had other issues to deal with, including facing charges for weapons, drugs, kidnapping and assault. He spent a large part of 2015 under house arrest. The original “Freeway” Ricky Ross attempted to sue Ross for using his name in 2010, but it was thrown out of court.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Then there was a feud with fellow rapper 50 Cent, which began in 2008. By the following year, Fiddy had taken to calling Ross "Officer Ricky" as the two rappers dissed each other over a series of records. The beef turned uglier still when Fiddy released a sex tape featuring Lastonia Leviston, the mother of one of Rick Ross’ children. The eventual court case, which Leviston would win, would be partly responsible for 50 Cent’s bankruptcy.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal and Health Scares</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having grown up in Miami, Ross is said to be a fan of the 1980s television cop show Miami Vice. Two of his trademarks that are often attributed to the influence of the show are his large, dark sunglasses and his slow, raspy vocal delivery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The father of four children, Ross endured a health scare in 2011 when he suffered multiple seizures on two separate flights on the same day. In March 2018, TMZ reported that the rapper had been hospitalized and hooked up to life support upon being found unresponsive at his home, before earning his discharge a few days later. However, his family disputed that account of events, suggesting that Ross's condition wasn't as bad as initially believed.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Book</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After 10 studio albums, the Grammy-nominated rapper became a published author with the September 2019 release of Hurricanes: A Memoir. The autobiography delved into Ross' upbringing and career on both sides of the law, as well as the headline-grabbing moments like the seizures that nearly killed him in 2011 and the attempt on his life via drive-by shooting in 2013.</p><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: William Leonard Roberts</li><li>Birth date: January 28, 1976</li><li>Birth State: Mississippi</li><li>Birth City: Coahoma Country</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Best Known For: Rick Ross is a rapper and entrepreneur who was the first artist signed to P.
