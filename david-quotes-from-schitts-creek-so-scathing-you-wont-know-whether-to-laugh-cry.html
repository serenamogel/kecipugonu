Not only does he help his mother Moira film her audition for The Crows Have Eyes III: The Crowening, but he gives Alexis endless relationship advice. (Albeit reluctantly.) He even lends Johnny some of his hard-earned money when the Rose patriarch hits a financial rough patch. However, that doesn't make <a href=# class=T3D>David's most scathing quotes on Schitt's Creek</a> any less of zingers.</p><p>Perhaps the only person who can return David's shade is Stevie, whose deadpan delivery often rivals his own. However, David's put-downs double as his way of expressing affection — the meaner they are, the more he loves you. Furthermore, it's not always what David says as much as the way he says it. His melodramatic facial expressions are second to none, and his creative intonations are often the cherry on top of an already deeply sarcastic remark. In honor of his biting humor, here are the <a href=# class=T3D>best David Rose quotes</a>, which are arguably the best of <a href=# class=T3D>Schitt’s Creek’s quotes</a>.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On the Town of Schitt's Creek</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 1, Episode 1.</strong> "What kind of sociopath abandons her family in some vomit-soaked dump to galavant around the world with her dumb, shipping-heir, loser boyfriend she's known for three months?!" David screams at Alexis, upon learning that she's jumping ship to be with Stavros.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Johnny's Dickensian "Night Shirt"</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 1, Episode 2.</strong> When Johnny and Moira discover a leak in their ceiling, Mr. Rose comes storming into his children's room wearing some unfortunate pajamas. "You might want to rethink the nightgown first — there's a whole Ebenezer Scrooge thing happening," David tells his dad. "My best to Bob Cratchit."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On His Parents' Getting Physical</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 1, Episode 5.</strong> David is naturally scarred after walking in on his parents in a compromising situation. "Shame on you for attempting that position at 8 o'clock in the morning!" he exclaims, unable to meet their eyes.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On How to Hack It In New York</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 1, Episode 13.</strong> When the Roses briefly sell Schitt's Creek, David plans to return to New York, asking Stevie to go with him. She replies that she wouldn't even know what to do with herself in such a big city, but David has some simple advice: “You just watch a season of Girls an do the opposite of what they do. It’s easy.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Blouse Barn's "Skanky" Clothes</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 2, Episode 4.</strong> When Roland wants Jocelyn to dress like Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, he enlists David's help. "Well this might be the closest we're going to get to Meryl," he says, holding up a dress at the Blouse Barn. "You know, if she got fired from her job at the magazine and started walking the streets."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Roland's Personal Style</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 2, Episode 11.</strong> "There's a collection of undershirts hang-drying outside of my room," a disturbed David tells Stevie. "Is there any way they could be removed? Or is there like, a Texas Chainsaw movie being filmed out there that I'm not aware of?"</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Alexis' Terrible Gaydar</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 4, Episode 1.</strong> After David tells Alexis that he and Patrick kissed, she's unconvinced that the feeling is mutual. Naturally, David doesn't take kindly to his sister's (thankfully unfounded) suspicions, telling her to “fall off a bridge, please.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Moira's Motherhood Skills</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 4, Episode 4. </strong>After Moira tells her daughter at-length about Ted's new, "striking older lover," David scolds his mother for hurting Alexis' feelings. “I have never heard someone say so many wrong things, one after the other, consecutively, in a row.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Alexis & Ted's "Electric Relationship"</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 5, Episode 1.</strong> David's upset when Alexis claims to have gotten a better score on M'Lady Magazine's "How Electric Is Your Relationship?" quiz from Summer 1991, and responds accordingly by saying, “eat glass!”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Patrick's Party-Planning Abilities</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 5, Episode 5.</strong> Patrick plans to host a housewarming party and refuses David's expertise. Naturally, David takes the snub in stride. “He told me he doesn’t want my help so I’m just going to play the supportive partner and watch him fail.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd"><h2>On Gel Time Moist Liquid's Unique Scent</h2></h2></p><p><strong>Season 5, Episode 10. </strong>David discovers that his old boss, Wendy, is selling an expensive foot cream that is actually just Gel Time Moist Liquid, 100 percent of which is... moist liquid. The cream has a, um, unique scent, which David illustrates with a colorful simile. “It smells like pennies and burps,” David says.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on March 13, 2019</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZp2Zpp6xbr3UqKueq12bv7C5jKyaoaGkqcBur9GenKRlo6R6tK%2FArZ%2BippdixrDBjLCmp6xdoLuww4ywn56smJq%2FbsDOZqOarZedeqS%2B2A%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-quotes-from-schitts-creek-so-scathing-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-cry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdavid-quotes-from-schitts-creek-so-scathing-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-cry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdavid-quotes-from-schitts-creek-so-scathing-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-cry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdavid-quotes-from-schitts-creek-so-scathing-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-cry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-quotes-from-schitts-creek-so-scathing-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-cry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-quotes-from-schitts-creek-so-scathing-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-cry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./billie-lourds-parents-meet-carrie-fisher-and-bryan-lourd.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./billie-lourds-parents-meet-carrie-fisher-and-bryan-lourd.html>Billie Lourds Parents: Meet Carrie Fisher and Bryan Lourd</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./selma-2014.html>Selma movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./selma-2014.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
