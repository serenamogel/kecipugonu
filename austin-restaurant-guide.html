They have a permanent location on east 7th street, but we first discovered it at the Saturday farmer’s market. Their vermicelli bowls are the best in town! I love how lemongrass-y the lemongrass tofu is and their sauce is two emoji thumbs up.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Piknik</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>Their brick and mortar restaurant is new this year – if you’re paleo, gluten free, or have any diet restriction, this is your spot. The food is made of the highest quality ingredients and is very health conscious. If you’re vegan, get the eggplant involtini. If you’re not vegan, get the hash. And don’t miss the matcha drinks.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Elizabeth (pictured above)</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>My most instagrammed restaurant (I can’t help it!) as well as a place Jack and I go to far too often.

Get the sweet potato taco – if you’re pescatarian, don’t miss the mojo fish taco. Jack eats meat, and his favorite is the Happy Taco. Don’t miss the Doña sauce if you like spicy things.</span></p><p class=p1><b><a href=#>Casa de Luz</a><br></b><span class=s1>When you’ve had too many margaritas, go here for some wholesome vegan macrobiotic food. Note that this is in no way fancy – there’s no alcohol and you pay up front. But what it has some the most flavorful macrobiotic cooking I’ve ever had, and the sauces they make are amazing. Check out their website for the meal of the day. If “suncheeze” is on the menu – go.</span></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/austin-restaurant-guide/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/File_000-2.jpg&description=Austin+Restaurant+Guide%3A+SXSW+2017")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Flower Child</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>This is one of those restaurants that makes it hard to decide what to order because I want to try one of everything. There are TONS of vegan and gluten free options, but there are sustainable meat options as well. I especially love their green curry soup (if it’s a special that day), the Indian Cauliflower, and the Thai Cashew Quinoa. The gluten free brownies are delectable.</span></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/austin-restaurant-guide/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/File_000-3.jpg&description=Austin+Restaurant+Guide%3A+SXSW+2017")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Poké Poké (pictured below)</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>If you like poke, don’t miss this one.

Favorites are: the tofu scramble burrito, the shiitake dumplings, the brussels sprout mushroom pizza (Jack’s favorite), and the vegan butternut squash pizza.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>The Steeping Room</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>When we lived a little closer to this place, we were regulars. Jack and I had a Sunday Steeping Room ritual which means that it’s basically our church. I love all of their soups (they rotate daily), the curries, the chocolate crunch tea, and their vegan double chocolate cupcakes. A great spot for vegan and gluten free options.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><b>Cafe No Sé</b></a><br></span><span class=s1>I’m putting this in the brunch section because it’s widely popular for brunch, even though Jack and I usually go for lunch or dinner (I hate crowds!).

It’s owned by the same folks that own Contigo (another favorite), what I love about the menu at Chicon is that the food is incredibly local and seasonal. Its style is Texas farm to table and while there are a lot of meaty dishes, they don’t ignore their vegetable offerings. The menu changes often but some of the best things I’ve had were a vegan sunflower seed risotto, a pho made with spaghetti squash instead of noodles, and a salad made of smoked and raw mushrooms (it’s hard to describe why the salad was so good but it was killer). I can go on and on but I’m going to stop here because I’m going on and on.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Lenoir</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>This one is a twofer, as they have both an excellent wine garden as well as a phenomenal restaurant. The wine garden not only has a lovely selection of wine, but they also serve yummy light snacks. The restaurant is a tiny cozy place that serves a highly seasonal prix fix menu using local ingredients, and you can choose the dishes you want from 4 categories: land (meat), sea (fish), earth (vegetarian), and dream (dessert).</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><strong>Other note-worry dinner places:</strong> <a href=#>Vox Table</a>, <a href=#>Olamaie</a>, <a href=#>Emmer & Rye</a>, <a href=#>Juniper</a></span></p><p class=p1><strong>BEVERAGES: Coffee/Juice</strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Juice Society</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>Love this new juice spot!&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Seventh Flag</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>I love their homemade almond milk chai</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><a href=#>Patika (Wed-Sun for breakfast)</a><br></b></span><span class=s1>We’ve been loving the breakfast here lately – their avocado toast with jalapeños, breakfast sandwiches, bowls, and their pastries are pretty darn good too.
