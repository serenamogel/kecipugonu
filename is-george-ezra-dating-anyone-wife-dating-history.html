He has never been married either. Ezra launched his first album “Wanted on Voyage” in 2014, after the success of his song “Budapest,” which reached at number one in the UK.</p><p>His second album, “Staying at Tamara’s,” debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and went on to become the second-best-selling album of 2018.
