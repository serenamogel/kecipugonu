The real question is, can they finally win a game?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>If you’re a fan of Jared Keeso’s Shoresy (or his series Letterkenny) and want to know all about the season 2 release date, cast, and how to watch this brilliant Canadian sitcom, then read ahead for our guide!</p><h2 id=h-what-is-shoresy-about data-injectable=false>What is Shoresy about?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shoresy3.jpg><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Shoresy follows the eponymous character, a former ice hockey star who is a creation of Jared Keeso and originally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on Keeso’s show Letterkenny</a>. In Letterkenny, Shoresy never showed his face, often being filmed from behind, or in positions where he was obscured. During scenes where he was playing or refereeing ice hockey, he wore a tinted visor.</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=936 data-injectable=true>In Shoresy, the former player heads to Sudbury, the home of the Bulldogs, quite possibly the worst professional team in Canada. At the beginning of the series, the Bulldogs have lost twenty games on the trot, and are rooted to the bottom of the table in their four-team league, the Triple A-level Northern Ontario Senior Hockey Organization (NOSHO). As a result of their poor form, they’re on the verge of being shut down, but veteran Shoresy makes a bet with the team general manager that he can get them back to winning ways, as long as he’s given full control.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Over the course of the first season, we saw Shoresy get a new coach, find a new crew of players, and inspire the Bulldogs to something beyond mediocrity (although they still lose, a lot). Along the way, the former player developed a love interest, which we may see more of in season two. Other potential plot points include the rickety Bulldog stadium being refurbished, as well as the team’s improvements.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When is the second season of Shoresy out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shoresy2.jpg><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>In April of this year, it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed via Tweet</a> that Shoresy had resumed production for season two, after an announcement in January that it would be returning. Hulu has now confirmed that the second season of the show will drop on October 27, 2023, doing so via a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">snazzy video on their official YouTube page</a>. The season will once again be six episodes long.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is the main cast in Shoresy season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jared-Keeso-1.jpg><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>A huge number of the season one cast are returning to Shoresy for season two.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jared Keeso as Shoresy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jared-Keeso-2.jpg><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Show creator Jared Keeso is reprising his role as Shoresy, the foul-mouthed, ultra-talented former hockey star turned manager of the struggling Sudbury Bulldogs. Keeso is mostly known for his other show Letterkenny, of which Shoresy is a spin-off. Letterkenny fans will also be getting a new season, so it’s been a busy time for Keeso.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tasya Teles as Nat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tasya-Teles.jpg><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Teles is most known for her time on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">critically acclaimed CW series The 100</a>, but in Shoresy she plays Nat, the owner of the Sudbury Bulldogs who is wary of Shoresy, but eventually comes around to his way of thinking. Despite the Bulldogs’ losing end to the season, she decided not to fold the team as planned, as she’s bought into the Shoresy way.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harlan Blayne Kytwayhat as Sanguinet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Harlan-Blayne-Kytwayhat-1.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Also known as Sanger, Sanguinet is Shoresy’s best friend in Sudbury and one of the few people he knows he can lean on at the beginning of the first season. A more positive foil to Shroesy’s style, the two complement each other well. Kytwayhat also appeared in the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2022 sci-fi horror Prey, part of the Predator franchise</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Blair Lamora as Ziigwan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blair-Lamora.png><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>One of Nat’s helpers, Ziigwan is funny, smart, and takes none of Shoresy’s rubbish. Blair Lamora puts in a great performance as the headstrong character who loves the game of hockey as much as anybody else in the series, the players included. Lamora has only had small appearances in other shows but was cast in the series Outlander.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Keilani Elizabeth Rose as Miigwan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Keilani-Elizabeth-Rose.png><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Miigwan is another of Nat’s loyal helpers and is played by Native actress Keilani Elizabeth Rose. Rose has appeared in a number of other shows, including a main role in the comedy Flimsy. In a tale as old as America itself, the Canadian performer was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shot in L.A. last year</a>, but thankfully made a solid recovery and is returning for season 2.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jonathan-Ismael Diaby as Dolo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jonathan-Ismael-Diaby.jpg><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Jonathan-Ismael Diaby is an ice hockey pro who was once a third-round pick for the big leagues. Although he is now mostly focusing on his rap, he basically plays himself in the show. Diaby was a surprisingly agile defenceman who is sadly known for suffering some seriously racist abuse from NHL viewers, including one incident where a so-called fan hurled racist epithets at him and his family. Now, though, he’s living his best life and appearing on this beloved show, whereas we assume that angry racist is continuing to live out a pathetic existence somewhere in the North American continent.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Terry Ryan as Ted Hitchcock/Hitch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Terry-Ryan.jpg><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Hitch is the smartmouthed, martini-loving former player, and like Dolo, is actually played by a former ice hockey star named Terry Ryan. In his earlier life, he played for the Montreal Canadians and has also been in several films and television shows since his retirement from the big leagues, including small parts in Schitt’s Creek and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Mamoa-led production Frontier</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ryan McDonell as Mark Michaels</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ryan-McDonell-.png><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Keeper Michaels had an entire downfall and redemption arc across season one of Shoresy, and we’re excited to see his character develop further now that he’s more involved in the team. He’s played by veteran Canadian actor Ryan McDonell, who has appeared in small roles in hit shows like Smallville.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Andrew “The Canon” Antsanen as Goody</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Andrew-Antsanen.jpg><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>Goody seems a bit slow and sweet, but he has real heart and is an integral part of the Bulldogs’ kind-of turnaround. He’s played by Andrew Antsanen, a former hockey player and MMA fighter who has turned his talents to acting. Shoresy is his only big acting credit so far, though.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who else will appear in Shoresy season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Letterkenny-Shoresy.png><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Plenty of other fan favorites will be rejoining for season two of Shoresy, including seasoned actors and a host of other former professional hockey players.</p><ul data-current-count=205.5 data-injectable=false><li>Max Bouffard as JJ</li><li>Jon “Nasty” Mirasty as Jim #1</li><li>Brandon Nolan as Jim #2</li><li>Jordan Nolan as Jim #3</li><li>Keegan Long as Liam</li><li>Bourke Cazabon as Cory</li></ul><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=503.5 data-injectable=true>In addition, there are a few other names that have been confirmed to appear in the show’s second season, including Frederick Roy (the son of Ice Hockey Hall of Fame goalie Patrick Roy), musician and internationally acclaimed pop star Rêve, actresses Catherine St-Laurent and Jordana Lajoie.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>Guest star appearances have also been confirmed, including Scott Thompson, Jonathan Torrens, Camille Sullivan, Eliana Jones, and Jacob Tierney.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How can I watch Shoresy season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shoresy-3.jpg><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>In its native Canada, Shoresy will be available on the on-demand service the Crave Network.
