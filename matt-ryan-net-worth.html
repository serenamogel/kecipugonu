The garden is attractive and offers pleasant views of the surrounding area.</p><p>Furthermore, the interior style is mostly modern, with certain portions resembling a farmhouse. The home’s ceilings are unusually high, allowing for plenty of airflow and circulation. The moment you step through the front door, you get a sense of openness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matt-ryan-house.jpg><p>This residence is about 30 minutes north of downtown Atlanta and still within the municipal borders of Atlanta, Georgia.
