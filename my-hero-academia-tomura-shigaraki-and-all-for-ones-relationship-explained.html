With the release of season six, it is finally time to see All for One’s plan come to fruition. What does he intend to do with Shigaraki leading the League of Villains? What do the heroes need to know in order to defeat them?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>The anime has only begun to scratch the surface of it all, but with Shigaraki set to become the world’s greatest threat, it’s important to remember where he came from. He’s a master of destruction and has only begun to get a hold of the true strength of his power. Like All Might has trained Deku, Shigaraki was never alone in his path to being a villain. All for One has been with him every step of the way and season six will reveal just how powerful that bond has become.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-all-for-one data-injectable=false>Who is All for One?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/All_For_One_28Past29-copy.jpg><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=831 data-injectable=true>All for One, originally named Shigaraki, possesses the power to take Quirks for himself and make them his own. His power is the reverse of his brother Yoichi, who possesses the opposite ability — he can give power to others. However as All for One can accumulate power, One for All can only give power from generation to generation. All for One’s greatest mission is to take One for All for himself, so he has been hunting the power ever since his brother passed, thus becoming the greatest antagonist of My Hero Academia.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>With the power of One for All, Shigaraki can take control as a lord over everyone. All Might has weakened One for All but his influence on others is what makes him stronger. In order to keep his influence, he formed the League of Villains and kept it running for generations. After he encountered Tenko Shimura, he knows he has the perfect successor to take over the role of leader.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-tomura-shigaraki data-injectable=false>Who is Tomura Shigaraki?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tomura-Shigaraki-in-My-Hero-Academia.jpg><p data-characters=621 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>When Shigaraki was younger, he went by the name of Tenko Shimura, a young boy who lived in the perfect nuclear family, made up of his mother, father, sister, dog, and both of his grandparents. Tenko had it all. He had big dreams of becoming a hero but his quirk had not manifested yet. However, he lived a strained family life. His grandmother, Nana Shimura, abandoned her son to go on and be a symbol of peace with the power of One for All. Her son held a lot of resentment for heroes overall and in turn abused his family. As a result, Tenko suffered from a lot of abuse despite attempting to keep a positive attitude.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Due to the abuse, Tenko’s Quirk manifested quickly and he destroyed his entire family, leaving only pieces of them behind. His mind became warped and his itch became worse. As he grew older, the skin around his face began to dry up from the scratching. Tenko found solace once he met All for One and became Tomura Shigaraki, leader of the League of Villains. He wears the hands of his family members on him and is growing in power with each season of My Hero Academia. Tomura Shigaraki is set to become the series’ biggest threat.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-relationship-between-tomura-shigaraki-and-all-for-one data-injectable=false>What is the relationship between Tomura Shigaraki and All for One?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tomura-and-All-For-One-in-My-Hero-Academica.jpg><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=true>All for One and Tomura Shigaraki have a twisted mentor relationship. After “adopting” Tenko as a young boy, he renames him Tomura Shigaraki, making it seem as though they are father and son via blood. Their relationship is built on the urge to destroy and take over everything. They both believe that heroes are a curse on society and therefore must undo the hero world that has been built. All for One makes Tomura feel calmer by giving him chances to continue destroying with his Quirk, stating that his urge to scratch is actually his urge to destroy.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>As motivation, All for One gifts Tomura the hands of his dead family, so they are always with him and can see his true calling. The plan is to have Tomura take over the power of All for One and make the evil plan come to fruition. Together, All for One and Tomura Shigaraki are on a mission to eliminate the hero population and acquire the power of One for All.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=false>My Hero Academia season 6 episodes air weekly, on Saturdays, on Crunchyroll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6msGaglae8bq3CmpuepZmWerW7zK6pmmWjnbaordGaoqJlkaOxbq3LpWSfp6JivK%2Bx0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllla29ra3Ip5ydZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-hero-academia-tomura-shigaraki-and-all-for-ones-relationship-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmy-hero-academia-tomura-shigaraki-and-all-for-ones-relationship-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmy-hero-academia-tomura-shigaraki-and-all-for-ones-relationship-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmy-hero-academia-tomura-shigaraki-and-all-for-ones-relationship-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-hero-academia-tomura-shigaraki-and-all-for-ones-relationship-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-hero-academia-tomura-shigaraki-and-all-for-ones-relationship-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aimee-bannister.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aimee-bannister.html>Aimee Bannister</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gil-gerard-net-worth-2024.html>Gil Gerard Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gil-gerard-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
