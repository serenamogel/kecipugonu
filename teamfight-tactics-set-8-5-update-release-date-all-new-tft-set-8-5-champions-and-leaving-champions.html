The game has eight sets, with the latest being Set 5: Reckoning. However, Riot Games, the developer of TFT, has announced the release of the TFT Set 8.5 Glitched Out Mid-set Mechanic Update on March 22, 2023. TFT Set 8.5 Glitched Out Mid-set Mechanic Update follows the tradition of mid-set updates that Riot Games introduced in TFT Set 3: Galaxies.</p><p>Mid-set updates are designed to shake up the game and provide new strategies for players. The TFT Set 8.5 mid-set update will introduce new champions, traits, and items. To test the new features before the official release, Riot Games will upload the TFT Set 8.5 changes to the Public Beta Environment (PBE) through Patch 13.5 on March 8. This gives players two weeks to try out the new mechanics and provide feedback to Riot Games. The PBE is a test server where players can experiment with new features without affecting their accounts on the live servers.</p><p>After the testing period, the TFT Set 8.5 Glitched Out Mid-set Mechanic Update will be launched on live servers through Patch 13.6 on March 22. The launch will be available on all platforms where TFT is available, including PC, Mac, Android, and iOS. One of the most exciting aspects of the mid-set update is the introduction of new champions. Riot Games has not revealed the names of the new champions yet, but they have hinted that they will have glitch-themed abilities.</p><p>The glitch theme is consistent with the name of the update, Glitched Out. The new champions will be available in the new Glitch trait, which is expected to complement the existing traits in Set 8. The mid-set update will also introduce new items, which will provide new strategies for players. The new items will be focused on the Glitch theme and will have unique abilities that can be used to gain an advantage over opponents. The new items will be available through the item carousel, where players can select items that fit their strategies. In addition to new champions and items, the mid-set update will also bring changes to existing champions and traits.</p><h2 id=tft_set_8_5_update_what_we_expect class=smooth-goto>TFT Set 8.5 Update What We Expect?</h2><p>TFT Set 8.5 is set to be released soon, but players will not have to wait long for some of the highly anticipated changes that come with it. These changes are arriving early through Patch 13.5, as revealed by game designer Stephen “Mortdog” Mortimer. Both item and Hero Augment distribution changes are now live on the PBE, and will soon be available on live servers. One of the significant changes that have been applied to Set Eight Hero Augments is the increased number of times players can reroll for an Augment that fits their composition. This change was implemented in Patch 13.3, giving players a better chance to tailor their Augments to their team’s needs. The TFT balance team has also added an odds table for Hero Augment Armories at Stages 3-2 and 4-2, which should help players better understand their chances of getting the desired Augments. The Monsters’ Attack! the mechanic has been the main focus of balance changes in Set Eight. The TFT balance team has made a large number of changes to this mechanic to make it more balanced and fair. With these changes, players can expect a more level playing field when it comes to Monsters’ Attack! and the game as a whole.</p><p>Most Mid-Set balance changes typically involve adding new traits and champions while removing those that are too difficult to balance or don’t fit into the new set theme. However, with Set Eight, the TFT balance team has taken a different approach. They have focused on refining the existing mechanics, rather than adding new ones. Regular Augments will remain unchanged, as they are an evergreen mechanic in TFT. Players can continue to use Regular Augments as they always have, and they will remain a crucial part of the game’s strategy. The changes coming with TFT Set 8.5 promise to shake things up in the game and make it more exciting for players. With Patch 13.5, players can look forward to getting a taste of these changes earlier than expected. The increased number of rerolls for Hero Augments and the odds table for Hero Augment Armories are just some of the changes that players can expect.</p><p>The Monsters’ Attack! the mechanic has been a point of contention among players since it was introduced in Set Eight. However, with the balance changes implemented in Patch 13.5, players can expect a more balanced and fair experience when it comes to this mechanic. This should help level the playing field and make the game more enjoyable for all players. In conclusion, the early arrival of TFT Set 8.5 changes through Patch 13.5 is great news for players who are eagerly anticipating the new content. The changes to Hero Augments and Monsters’ Attack! will make the game more balanced and exciting, while Regular Augments remain a crucial part of the game’s strategy. Overall, players can look forward to a more enjoyable and engaging TFT experience with these changes.</p><h2 id=all_new_tft_set_8_5_champions_and_leaving_champions class=smooth-goto>All New TFT Set 8.5 Champions And Leaving Champions</h2><p>The popular auto battler game Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is about to get a Mid-Set update, and with it comes some significant changes. One of the major updates is the removal of three Set Eight traits, namely Recon, Civilian, and Arsenal. These traits were support-based, and while they impacted Monsters Attack!, they were not vertical traits. Recon was a trait that allowed players to scout their opponents’ teams, while Civilian was a trait that gave players a gold bonus if they managed to win a round without any champions dying.</p><p>Arsenal was a unique trait to Aphelios, giving him a unique weapon that could change with each round. In addition to the removal of these traits, 15 champions will be removed from the game. These include primary carriers such as Galio, Talon, Sivir, and Yuumi. Six of the removed champions were four-cost units, which were heavily used in Set Eight. Players will have to adjust their gameplay to the new meta in Set 8.5. Not all primary carriers were removed from the game, however. Samira and Viego will stick around for Set 8.5, with Viego gaining the Heart trait in addition to Ox Force and Renegade. Samira will keep her original traits, which means players can still use her in their lineup.</p><p>Players will be able to test out the Set 8.5 meta through the PBE servers, which will be available from March 8. The official launch of Glitched Out! will take place on March 22 with Patch 13.6. The removal of these traits and champions will significantly impact the game’s strategy and playstyle. Players will have to rethink their team compositions and adjust their playstyles accordingly. With new champions and traits coming into the game, players will have to experiment and find the best combinations to succeed.</p><p>The Mid-Set update is a common occurrence in TFT and allows the game’s developers to make significant changes and balance the game. It also keeps the game fresh and exciting, providing players with new challenges and opportunities to discover new strategies. The PBE servers will give players the chance to test out the new meta and discover the new combinations of champions and traits that work best for them. It will also give players the chance to provide feedback to the developers, helping them to balance the game and make it even better.</p><p>In conclusion, the Mid-Set update for TFT Set Eight will bring significant changes to the game. With the removal of three traits and 15 champions, players will have to adjust their strategies and rethink their team compositions. However, with new champions and traits being added to the game, players will have the opportunity to discover new combinations and find new ways to succeed. The PBE servers will give players the chance to test out the new meta and provide feedback to the developers, making the game even better. The official launch of Glitched Out! on March 22 with Patch 13.6 is sure to be an exciting time for TFT players worldwide.</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
